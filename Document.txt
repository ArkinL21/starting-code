The design decision used was using light colors for main, and dark colours for hovering.

Used the colors and transitions already listed in the root, to mintain consistency, the color red was used;
but mainly for testing and has been removed.

Challenges:

* Modal gave me a difficult time but have understood it, not particularly proud of my styling, manly because the 
moment page reloads it pops up, without pressing the modal button, second struggled to align the background
and front.

*Overlapping elements - my content was overlapping but fixed this with position.

*Animation n general.

*When I press the customize button a windows slides in but not all the way so cannot use it properly.
